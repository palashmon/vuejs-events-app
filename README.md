Learning vuejs basics by building a events bulletin board application

Following logics have been added so far:

- [x] Creating a Vue Instance
- [x] When the application loads, we want to call the method that initializes some data
- [x] Initially we will do this using array of objects, just to get started.
- [x] Add an event to the existing events array
- [x] Delete an event from events array based on index
- [ ] To do list

Thanks!
